The primary energy consumption in India is the third biggest after China and USA with 5.6% global share in 2017. The energy policy of India is largely defined by the country's expanding energy deficit and increased focus on developing alternative sources of energy, particularly nuclear, solar and wind energy. India ranks 81 position in overall energy self-sufficiency at 66% in 2017.
India's energy crisis is set to deepen as top producers of coal, natural gas and oil recently said their output will grow little in the next few of years â€“ not what the country wants to hear at a time when its thirst for fuel shows no sign of abating. This means more fuel imports and costlier import bills at energy companies. It also means India's energy sector is becoming increasingly vulnerable to global supply disruptions and price volatility due to events like Australia's floods and unrest in the Middle East.

Deliverables:
-	Dashboard to understand energy deficit/surplus across states.
-	Dashboard to understand future energy demand in a fully electric India. (PM Modi Promise)
-	Data-Driven (Presentation: Visualization, Dashboard, or Storyboard) recommendation on which source of energy to install in each region.

Assumptions:
-	The government will only subsidize energy if it shows a higher than average relationship between energy consumption and GDP. Further they will give preference to states that have an upcoming general election next year.
-	2019 is a pivotal year for elections; one of the main agenda items that the ruling party will use to incentives citizenry is electronification of all of India (Rural and Villages).
